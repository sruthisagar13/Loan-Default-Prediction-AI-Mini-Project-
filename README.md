Loan Default Prediciton
* The main objective is to predict if a loan is going to be paid or not.

With our target variable defaulted:

* defaulted = 1 (failed to pay the loan)
* non defaulted = 0 (paid the loan)
* We are predicting that who's not going to pay their loan!

The dataset has 5 features and 10000 rows.
